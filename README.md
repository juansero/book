# IArtificial Intelligence with Python - Notebooks Repository

This repository accompanies the book **"Artificial Intelligence with Python"** by Juan Sellés. It contains example notebooks extracted and adapted from the content of the book. The original images from the manuscript have not been modified..


## Contents

- `1_EDA.ipynb` — Exploratory Data Analysis (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn): Examples of histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps.
- '2_Regression_Linear.ipynb' — Linear Regression with scikit-learn (simulated example).
- '3_Classification_Tree.ipynb' — Simple Classification with DecisionTreeClassifier and tree visualization.
- '4_NN_Keras_MLP.ipynb' — Simple Neural Network with TensorFlow/Keras (educational example).
- '5_Diffusion_Toy_Denoising_AE.ipynb' — Educational demo: Denoising autoencoder illustrating the concept of "removing noise" (related to diffusion models).
- '6_Transformers_Intro.ipynb' — Tokenization Example / Transformers pipeline (requires installing transformers).

## How to Use

Recommended: Open in **Google Colab** or your local environment with Jupyter. For Colab, upload the notebook or create a new Colab and use 'File -> Upload notebook'.

Suggested Requirements:
- Python 3.8+
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow(for notebooks 4 and 5) — already available in Colab
- transformers (optional, for notebook 6)

Quick Installation (Local Environment):
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow transformers
```
